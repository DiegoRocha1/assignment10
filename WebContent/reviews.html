	<p>Our family appreciates all of your newsletters! They are really
		wonderful for the parents of your little patients. I just overheard
		someone talking about your H1N1 vaccine newsletter at the girlsâ€™ dance
		class. She was saying how great it was. It's amazing how many parents
		you've reached out to and given the knowledge to make their own
		decisions. It's really great!</p>

	<p>I thank you from the bottom of my heart for attending to
		Alexandra on Tuesday evening. When she woke with that familiar, yet
		horrifying bark of the croup virus, I felt a tremendous sense of
		relief knowing that we had you on our team. As you promised, you were
		a phone call away... and within minutes, you were at our doorstep.</p>
	<p>It was so wonderful and comforting to have such a fine
		pediatrician for our first child. We sincerely appreciate your time,
		patience and warm hospitality during our visits to your office. You
		always made us feel at ease, and everything you suggested in response
		to our concerns was very helpful!</p>
	<p>Almost three years ago, just before my daughter was born, I met
		Dr. Delta for the first time. As a first time mom, I had many
		questions and concerns (and still do, as she can attest!). From the
		very beginning she was thoughtful and caring and put my mind at ease
		about being a new mom.</p>
