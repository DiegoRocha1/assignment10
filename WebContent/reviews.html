		<p>As parents of four children, my wife and I have always put the
			medical care of our children as top priority. Relocating to Tucson,
			AZ from the Boston, MA area meant leaving our wonderful pediatrician,
			trained at Boston Children's Hospital, behind.</p>
		<p>For the first three years in Tucson, AZ we had three different
			pediatric practices, none of which we felt gave our children
			satisfactory attention and care. On one Saturday we were waiting in
			the waiting room for 2 and 1/2 hours with our 3 year old who had been
			up all night suffering from an ear infection. A parent sitting next
			to us, feeling the same frustration, told us about a new pediatric
			practice, ISTA Pediatrics</p>
		<p>After meeting with Dr. Alpha and discussing concepts and
			philosophy in the care of our children, we felt strongly that our
			decision to put our children under his care was a good one. Dr. Alpha
			has been kind, gentle, caring and fully accessible at all times. Our
			children know and trust him. He has been spot on in many instances in
			diagnosing and treating our children on various ailments and
			injuries. We especially appreciate his home style approach and his
			caring demeanor. He has enlightened us in many ways of natural and
			holistic approaches we have implemented successfully in the everyday
			child care elements of our family. We don't know what we would do
			without him.</p>

		<p>Thank you for this opportunity to share our thoughts on the
			greatness of Dr. Alpha and ISTA Pediatrics.</p>

		<p>Our family appreciates all of your newsletters! They are really
			wonderful for the parents of your little patients. I just overheard
			someone talking about your H1N1 vaccine newsletter at the girls’
			dance class. She was saying how great it was. It's amazing how many
			parents you've reached out to and given the knowledge to make their
			own decisions. It's really great!</p>

		<p>I thank you from the bottom of my heart for attending to
			Alexandra on Tuesday evening. When she woke with that familiar, yet
			horrifying bark of the croup virus, I felt a tremendous sense of
			relief knowing that we had you on our team. As you promised, you were
			a phone call away... and within minutes, you were at our doorstep.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="rev">
		<p>It was so wonderful and comforting to have such a fine
			pediatrician for our first child. We sincerely appreciate your time,
			patience and warm hospitality during our visits to your office. You
			always made us feel at ease, and everything you suggested in response
			to our concerns was very helpful!</p>

		<p>Almost three years ago, just before my daughter was born, I met
			Dr. Delta for the first time. As a first time mom, I had many
			questions and concerns (and still do, as she can attest!). From the
			very beginning she was thoughtful and caring and put my mind at ease
			about being a new mom.</p>
	</div>
<!-- 	<div class="rev">
		<p>It’s been a little over four weeks since our baby girl had her
			first appointment with ISTA Pediatrics. And I am still wowed by the
			experience my family and I were exposed to. If you haven’t been told
			lately, I will take the time to tell you now…. you are all marvelous
			at what you do as physicians!</p>
